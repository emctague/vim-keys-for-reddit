# Vim Keys for Reddit

This is a minimal Safari clone of the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com).
Unfortunately, the Reddit Enhancement Suite doesn't support Safari - so this project introduces support.

##  [Install Latest Version](https://github.com/emctague/vim-keys-for-reddit/releases/latest/download/Vim.Keys.for.Reddit.zip)

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/emctague/vim-keys-for-reddit/releases-latest). Install it by downloading, unzipping, and then dragging it to your Applications folder. Make sure it's enabled in your Safari extension settings, too!
