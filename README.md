# Vim Keys for Reddit

This is a minimal Safari clone of the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com).
Unfortunately, the Reddit Enhancement Suite doesn't support Safari - so this project introduces support.

##  [Install](https://l.tague.me/vim-keys-for-reddit)

You can download the latest version from https://l.tague.me/vim-keys-for-reddit. Install it by downloading, unzipping, and then dragging it to your Applications folder. Make sure it's enabled in your Safari extension settings, too!
